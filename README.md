# Activity_Tracker_Data

### Situation and Goal

I am a lifelong learner who can't stop learning about new things and challenges. Some subjects required hand-on practice, some subject required focus on absorption. There are also other tasks or more important actions that may be more important than the lessons at the time. Overall, the more things you do simultaneously, the harder to finish one thing at a time. However, many tasks cannot be finished within a timeframe of choosing, especially the ones that you wait for response from an external party. Reading emails is something you can do everyday, but going to a event depend on whether the event is scheduled. 

Data Science is the combination of Computer Programming, Statistics and Design. When I focus on statistic theories, I might neglect design theories. When I tired coding for algorithms, I might neglect relational database and so forth. There are only a limited time per each day after all.

With a good feedback visualization, I can see how much productivity I had per weekon the things I wanted to do and not ignore other subjects. 

The simple goal is to build a scalable software that enabled data entry and visualization of daily activity.

### Action

It is best to start with Pythons libraries. Most of the features can be done with a spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Spreadsheet. However, Pandas had much less startup time, more flexible in its data transformation options, more efficient in general. Its data can be visualized with Matplotlibs. 

For interactive visualizations, the choice would have been either JavaScript D3 library or Tableau. However, since this is a minor side project, the focus at first is to do it the easy parts at first. Pandas and Matplotlib are two of the most useful tools I am comfortable with. I want to practice using them again.  

After the easy parts done, loading the data and visualization into an SQL database or a Mongodb, could be the next steps. Using a flask libray can also made easier interaction with web.

There might have been better productivity tools in the market, but I rather build one from scratch to practice, have fun and suitable for me. The one uploaded in this repository is a template.
